The token ring network protocol is a collision free protocol which connects the nodes in a ring topology.
This project, built with the help of Java, is a simulation of the token ring protocol.

Following are the features of this simulation :-
- The user can choose no. of nodes as 3,4,5 or 6.
- A simple graphic simulation.
- A table is displayed which shows the queued packets at all the nodes.
- The token can only take a new packet once it has delivered a packet it already has.
- The problem of starvation has been taken into consideration and avoided in the simulation.
